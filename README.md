# Potential of everything
Simple game that made with [Love2D](https://www.love2d.org/).   

Don't forget to add sound resources and change lines with their imports. See `main.lua`. Game supposed to be played with _Souleye â€“ Predestined Fate_ on background. But I can't publish this soundtrack on git of course. So import anything you like :)
## Controls
- `W / S` to move
- `Space` to start game
